stx->list can return #f (documentation says its return type is list?)

Racket is the new JavaScript.  In JavaScript:

<example from talk>

In Racket:

> (define (f g)
    (define g g)
    g)
> (f 3)
#<undefined>

The docs are contradictory.  They say:

  (stx-car v) -> any
    v : stx-pair?

  Takes the car of a _syntax_pair_.

But clicking on the link says

  A syntax pair is a pair containing a syntax object as its first
  element, and [... the rest ...]

So why would STX-CAR return any rather a syntax object?

The contract for STX-CDR is similarly much broader than necessary, but
the problem is even more egregious for STX-CAR.
